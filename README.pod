=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

    [SmokeTests]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a L<Dist::Zilla> plugin that modifies F<Makefile.PL> in such a way
that, when run, the C<test> argument passed to L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> will
include your smoke tests if (and only if) C<$ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING}> is set.
This variable is set when your distribution is being run by an automated
testing (smoker) system.

=head2 C<finder>

=for stopwords FileFinder

This is the name of a L<FileFinder|Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinder> for finding
your smoke test files to include in F<Makefile.PL>.  By default, a special value
is used which references files matching F<xt/smoke/*.t>.

Predefined finders are listed in
L<Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinderUser/default_finders>.
You can define your own with the
L<[FileFinder::ByName]|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::FileFinder::ByName> and
L<[FileFinder::Filter]|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::FileFinder::Filter> plugins.
